description: I'm bird photographer and gamer.

I decided to make this website to show off some things I've been doing and besides I always wanted to have a website.

You can find my best photos in the [Works](./works) section.

I sometimes post blogs of birding sessions I've recently been doing in the [Blogs](./blogs) section.

## About Me

I have been taking photos of birds since 2023 and I really enjoy doing it. Although I may not have the best camera (Nikon B500) I still think I've got some nice photos. Before I started bird photography I had quite some knowledge in coding languages such as JS, Python, TypeScript, and a few others. You can find some of my old projects on [Github](https://github.com/jem20). As for academics I am a high school graduate and I might start college in late 2025 / early 2026.
